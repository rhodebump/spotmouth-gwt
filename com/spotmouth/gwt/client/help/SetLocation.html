<h2>Set Location</h2>

<div id="help">

    <p>
        spotmouth will try to figure out your location. It will try to do this by asking your browser (or mobile phone)
        for your location. A location consists of a pair of numbers which are called a longitude and a latitude
    </p>

    <p>If spotmouth cannot figure out your location, it will take you to a form that will allow you to set your
        location. A location can be set in 3 different ways.
    </p>

    <h1>Previous Locations</h1>

    <p>Choose this and you can choose from a list of previous locations that you have set.</p>

    <h1>View Map</h1>

    <p>This will present a map that allows you to move around. Clicking on the map sets your location.</p>

    <h1>Location form</h1>

    <p>Completing the form (city, state, zip) and hitting "Set Location" will set your location</p>

    <p>Once spotmouth has your location, will be taken to the spotmouth "Home" screen. Nearby spots to your location
        will be shown to you. For each nearby spot, its name and address will be displayed alongwith the text, image and
        user profile picture that belongs to the last mark of that spot.
        Clicking on "spot related" information will take you to that spot detail screen.
        Clicking on the "mark related" information will take you to that mark detail screen.
