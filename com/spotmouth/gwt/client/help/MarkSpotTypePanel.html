<h2>Mark Spot</h2>

<div id="help">

    <p>
        You want to need to choose what type of mark you want to leave.
    </p>


    <p>

        A place represents something that has a street address such as a residence, school or restaurant.
    </p>

    <p>
        A plate, short for "license plate", is a way to mark a vehicle if you know the license plate. Even if you don't
        know the whole license plate, you can use our
        power search screens to try to find the license plate that you want to mark.
    </p>

    <p>
        A location is something that isn't a place or a plate. It's just where you are and will not be associated with a
        street address. If you are stuck in traffic, you can "Mark Location" to send a message to those around you and
        find out what is going on.
