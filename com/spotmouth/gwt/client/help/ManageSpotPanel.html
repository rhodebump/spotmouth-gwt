    <h1>Lock</h1>

    <p>Locking a spot prevents the modification of the spot by unauthorized people.  A spot is automatically locked whenever the first party edits the spot.
    If a second party attempts to edit the spot, they will not be authorized to do so, however, an email will be sent to the first party when a link to
        grant access to the second party.

    <p>In the case that the first party is not a valid owner of the spot, the valid owner of the stop will have to contact spotmouth using the contact form to obtain access to the locked spot.</p>

    <p>
        Only when a spot is locked can coupons, events, websites, mailing lists and a host of other features can be utilized for the spot.
