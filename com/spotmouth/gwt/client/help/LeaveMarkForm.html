        Secret Key: If you provide a secret key, this mark (and it's associated files) will only be able to be seen if
        you provide the secret key to unlock it.

        Secret keys can be used to provide your own contests and games. For example, you can use a secret key mark at
        spot a, the mark would be a clue to spot b, and so on...
