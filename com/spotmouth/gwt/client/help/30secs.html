 <p>
Spots are places, locations or license plates.

spotmouth allows users to leave marks on spots.  Marks consist of text, video and audio.  spotmouth allows users to be notified of marks others leave.  A good usage of spotmouth would be if you are stuck in traffic, you can use spotmouth to post "What's causing this traffic jam?", and others running the spotmouth mobile application (within the geographic proximity of you) can respond with either an answer, or commiserate with you on the traffic jam.

spotmouth allows spot owners (owners of businesses) to manage their listing information, create coupons and events.  All the information they enter is published to multiple places on the Internet, so they no longer have to enter their event in four different places.
        In addition, spotmouth allows business owners to create their very own website, create and manage email addresses for their business and employees, accounting software, survey software, wikis and much much more.
